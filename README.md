Documentation and scripts for Project Naranja, which is used for encrypting
filesystems on Linux

Project Naranja uses the Padlock Security Engine of VIA EPIA mini-ITX
motherboards in order to provide a toolkit that will let end-users easily set
up and use encrypted filesystems with Linux. To this end, the steps and
procedures needed to set up encryption have been documented here, and tools
have been created that allow for local/remote mounting of the encrypted
filesystems after a reboot.
